This thing sits on my patio and stores my dog poop until garbage day.  It contains the smell; there is no odor around or near it.  Of course, when you open it up, it smells like dog poop, but how are you going to stop that.  It has like a double lid thing going on which is nice.  The main opening allows me to put garbage bags in and take them out and also keeps them securely in place.  The smaller lid opens up allowing me to dump dog poop straight from the pooper scooper without messing with the bag or worrying about getting my hands dirty.  Also, I have had this thing sitting in the sun for more than a year now and it has held its original color.  I expected it to fade, but so far, so good.",

          "text": "Ok I've has this trash can for a couple of months now. I wanted to live with it before I reviewed it. I have this inside, in the kitchen, because it does look that nice, and I like a big trash can that I don't have to empty every 2 days. I love the overall look, the way the lid holds the bag in place, the way the lid locks if you need it. Now this is what I HATE....when I take the full bag out, it's a struggle, and the bag usually rips because the inside is not smooth, it has ridges made into the resin that catch the full bag and rip it as you pull. If they could make the inside smooth, this would be the absolutely perfect trash can. And I know, you could put less trash in it so the bag wouldn't be so full and push against the inside as you try to take it out.....but that kind of defeats the purpose of having a large trash can, doesn't it? You use a large trash can because you want it to hold a lot of trash so you have to empty it less often and use fewer bags. I do have an idea on how to fix this, and I'll be trying it out probably in the next few days. I'm either going to cut 4 pieces of either cardboard or flat plastic, and tape it to the 4 inside walls to make them smooth. It won't change the capacity, and it should make the shredded bag problem go away. But should I have to do this, or should it just be made that way? With just a little more real world testing, it should have been obvious to the company that it tears the bags when the bag is full. Oh well, nothing is perfect.......UPDATE 5/20/14......I have fixed the inside of the trash can so it no longer rips the bags! Here's what you do. I went to wally world, and got a cardboard box, it's in the packing supply section. The size you need is 14 by 14 by 14, it comes folded flat, it's 68 cents. When you open it, it fits almost perfectly down into the inside of the trash can. You do have to wiggle it a bit, as it's not quite exactly the same size, but it fits great when you get it all the way in. Then just trim the top of the box so it's just inside the lid so it will close, and there you go, the bags just slide right out, no matter how full! You're welcome lol!!",

          "text": "I have read that many customers complain about the bag ripping when removing it from the bin.  We purchase 33 gallon bags from Amazon, with the description provided below.  Not once have these bags ripped while being removed from this bin.  While these bags do not come with the convenient drawstrings, they do have twist ties.  They are very thick, and we paid about $23.00 for 100 bags.  I believe the tearing occurs when the bag is very full or contains sharp objects, or at least that has been my experience.  We have never had one of these very thick 33 gallon bags rip while removing it from the bin.  This is the description of the bags we purchased from Amazon which, for us, is nearly a on year supply:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077SQHBTW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=  If the link doesn't work this is the description:  Trash Bags 33 Gallon, Large Black Garbage Bags, 100/Count, 33\"W x 39\"H, (Black)  The cost is $22.95 for 100 bags.The photo I have posted, taken today, is of a 5 year, 4 month old Suncast Outdoor Trash Hideaway, which I purchased from Amazon in April, 2013.  Since that time the bin has been sitting on my covered patio in an area that faces the morning sun until at least 11:00 to noon during the long summer months, with temperatures of 90-100 degrees, or higher.  Our town requires that all trash be bagged, so we put a 33 gallon trash bag in the bin.  Each day we empty the trash bins from the house into the bag in the Suncast bin.  When the trash bag is full we take it out to the large containers provided by the town that are stored behind our house, usually twice a week.  I am writing this review now because we recently purchased a 2nd Suncast bin when we found that they also come in a lighter (beige?) color, which matches the patio colors, block wall, etc., and blends in better than the dark brown.  HOWEVER, our more than 5 year old Suncast bin is STILL in nearly perfect condition.  The photo shows that it is kind of dirty/dusty right now because we have had several monsoon dust storms in the last few days, but we normally hose it off once a week and it cleans up like new.  It is also almost waterproof.  It can be hosed off without water getting into the trash bag.  When we have had severe storms where the rain has come down very hard and sideways there have been a couple of times where a little water got into the bag in the bin.  The ONLY thing wrong with this bin, which was my fault, is that the plastic/rubber hinges partially broke when I knocked it over while the cover was open.  However, it has in no way affected the way it seals the top.  While I normally would not write a long review about a product designed to hold trash, I do feel that the quality and design of this product at such a reasonable price deserves to be acknowledged.  Because the top provides a pretty good seal we can have the bin near our back door without attracting dozens of flies.  We will use the old bin, which will fit neatly into a garage corner,  for storing smaller garden items-trimmers, small shovels, etc.  I believe this  product will be around long after we're gone :)",

For the price, it is fine and much like we anticipated.- The latching feature is functional and needed for our use.- It was easy to assemble and the resin construction should hold up well outside.Cons:- The trash bag will rip ... plain and simple.  I read the other reviews before ordering and thought we'll just be careful.  If you are actually putting trash into this container (duh), it is going to expand enough that the inside ribs will catch it and tear it.  I had read Marty B's review about using a 14x14x14 carboard box as a liner.  Bought one at our local blue discount store for cheap, but really?!?!?  There is no way I can give more than one star when a manufacturer ignores so many complaints about a design defect.  Heck, if they don't want to redesign, they could add a fold-out plastic liner to insert after assembly.",

While I normally would not write a long review about a product designed to hold trash, I do feel that the quality and design of this product at such a reasonable price deserves to be acknowledged.  Because the top provides a pretty good seal we can have the bin near our back door without attracting dozens of flies.  We will use the old bin, which will fit neatly into a garage corner,  for storing smaller garden items-trimmers, small shovels, etc.  I believe this  product will be around long after we're gone :)",

They stay closed nicely so even if the dog finds a way to tip it over he can't get in it and spread garbage. Two others we use to sort recycles (glass, cans, plastics) for our association at our summer condo. The last set I gave to some friends for their man-cave. They love them! They are very attractive, large and well worth the price! I made signs and laminated them for inside the lids to indicate what goes in them. They stay very dry.",

I saw a review that said it would contain that smell however I was really skeptical.  When I first saw it in the flat pack, I was really disappointed, it looked so much smaller than I expected but I was completely wrong.  The 33 gallon bag fits in there perfectly and it held 2 weeks of trash.  This thing looks small but it is deceiving, it still wasnât full after two weeks.  I think it would have held almost 3 weeks of all my trash. (3 tall kitchen bags full).  I know that the compact aspect of it is amazing but it doesnât hold a candle to the containment of the smell.  It sits in the sun till noon and walking past I still smelled nothing.  I donât know how it does it but itâs true.  It was easy for me to put together by myself and needed no tools.  The lid is easy to operate it opens two ways one to put trash in )like a little window) and then the whole lid lifts up to take the trash out.  That way the bag never slips.  This is the most amazing trash can Iâve come across in 54 years and I think it will outlast me lol.  I would definitely recommend it.",

The front piece, bows inward, leaving a massive gap between the lid connector, which is what holds the lid on the container. Very disappointed.

If it's just us, I throw our garbage out in the kitchen garbage anyway.  I'm buying another one right now to put on the other side of the grill for bottles/cans for this year's parties!

The benefit is that we can keep a much smaller recycling container in the kitchen which we can empty as needed into this large bin.  The Suncast bin is attractive and looks great on our lighter color deck.  The top has a locking mechanism that simply slides in to lock but this does not provide any kind of &#34;click&#34; or feedback that it is securely locked into place.  However, we have not had any issues with any animal tampering.  The item arrived unassembled. Assembly was very easy but it must be done in the order indicated in the instructions since some panels have grooves which are inaccessible once other pieces are snapped in place (leaving no gap for the next panel to be inserted).  So long as you snap the pieces in the correct order, this easily assembles in just a few minutes.  You're left with a very sturdy and handsome resin container that has the appearance of wood and wicker.  One word of caution: This bin should only be used with durable trash bags as the interior walls have many hard edges due to the structural plastic interior.  I have attached a close up photo of the interior ridges I am referring to.  I haven't had problems getting the bags out of the bin but thinner bags will have small snag holes and if the bag gets too full, I imagine this could very easily become problematic as it may cause a large tear as you attempt to pull the bag from the bin.  Do not let this deter you however.  These interior ridges allow the unit to be very sturdy without adding much weight.  As far as using a trash bag, this involves popping open the main door on top, inserting a bag and wrapping the opening over the top edges before you close and press the top until snapped into place.  This seems to hold the bag and we've had no issues with the bag dropping out or coming free until full.  Reverse the process to remove the bag and put a fresh bag in.  If I have any issues, I'll be sure to come back here and post an update.",

I use it in my kitchen because I don't like to take out the trash every day like with 13 gallon bins. The lid is great and keeps anything from ever smelling. Thanks to one of the other reviewers tips, when I first received it I took the cardboard box it came in apart and lined the inside of the bin with cardboard, and duct taped the ends together so it will stay in place. The reason for this is that the way that the pieces of the bin are made, there are plastic lines inside each side on the inside, and it could rip the trash bag if it gets too full. So you just cut the cardboard box it came in open, and fold it to fit in the bin, then duct tape the ends together and cut it so it's shorter than the lid. You never see the cardboard unless you take out the trash bag, and even then it just looks like solid cardboard inner walls so no big deal. Also it was easy to put together when I first received it. I am a small 23 year old woman and I put it together and lined it with cardboard in less than an hour the day it arrived. I have now had it for at least 6 months and I still am happy with it.",

For the price, it is fine and much like we anticipated.- The latching feature is functional and needed for our use.- It was easy to assemble and the resin construction should hold up well outside.Cons:- The trash bag will rip ... plain and simple.  I read the other reviews before ordering and thought we'll just be careful.  If you are actually putting trash into this container (duh), it is going to expand enough that the inside ribs will catch it and tear it.  I had read Marty B's review about using a 14x14x14 carboard box as a liner.  Bought one at our local blue discount store for cheap, but really?!?!?  There is no way I can give more than one star when a manufacturer ignores so many complaints about a design defect.  Heck, if they don't want to redesign, they could add a fold-out plastic liner to insert after assembly.",

Or b) you manually pull the garbage out and put it in another bag.I cannot believe that the manufacturer would sell such a defective product. They didnât test it? It would be a simple modification to bevel that area so it doesnât snag. The protrusion doesnât appear to perform any function other than maybe adding some thickness for strength, but they could still do that and bevel the end so that the bag slides over it rather than catching on the squared off end. Itâs like you drove a nail into your garbage can and expected it not to catch and tear the bags. Outrageous. Itâs the worst designed product Iâve seen in a long time and I buy a lot of stuff.",

This reflects both a failure in manufacturing and the absence of subsequent quality control measures. Similarly, the second attached photo shows the hatch (which is a part of the lid) and its latching mechanism.  The latch does not work correctly, because once again the casting is crooked, and because quality-control at Suncast entirely missed the problem and packaged this \"horror show\" for shipping to Amazon and for eventual retail sale.VERY DISAPPOINTING -- I have other Suncast products, and the fit-and-finish on these are just fine.",

I'd like to hear what you think.(1)\"Before you begin...read instructions prior to assembly.\" (2)\"This kit contains parts that can be damaged if incorrectly assembled.\" (3)\"Suncast is not responsible for replacing parts lost or damaged due to incorrect assembly.\" And my favorite: (4)\"Please follow instructions.\"Problem: THERE WERE NO INSTRUCTIONS in or on the shipping box or attached to any of the labeled and unlabeled parts.A search on Amazon (You can find it between âPRODUCT INFORMATIONâ and \"VIDEOSâ), provides valuable links to two PDFs: \"User Manual\" and \"Product Documentation.\" Both mention the above points.If only Suncast could tell me how I can attach the bottom of my \"Suncast 33 Gallon Hideaway Can Resin Outdoor Trash with Lid Use in Backyard, Deck, or Patioâ¦,\" it could serve its purpose well; if not, the bottom and the trash bag w/ its weekly collection of dog waste material will drop out.I wonder if the two recently-drilled holes in the bottom and back panel (I didn't drill them) hold the key to a possible solution? If nothing else, maybe I can use a zip tie andâ¦ I better check the User Manual and Product Information links again to be sure. But first I'll contact Suncast and get their take on my problem.It's Friday, 04/30/2021. I'll wait until 05/21/2021 before I post this review.Saturday, 05/22/2021. No response from Suncast. Review submitted to Amazon.",

But my not so great review is because we have only been actively using this for about a month (one for bottles/cans) and one for trash. THREE times now we have had maggot problems. The can is so big that it should be able to hold quite a bit. I only got them so I dont have to keep lugging paper plates and lunch trash in and out of my house with 2 babies (I dont have a nice sliding glass door to a patio right there waiting for me)... So we change the bag weekly before garbage day. I hate wasting a huge garbage bag on on having to take out trash that is 1/4 full but we do because its mostly from just lunchtime throughout the week. But from even just that little bit, we have had such a major maggot problem.  These containers dont have a good enough seal on them to keep bugs out. Its sooooooo frustrating.I am hoping the bottles/cans one is ok but I am not holding my breath because inside I see some fruit flies when I open the lid.People joke and call me OCD, I am a very clean person and am constantly sweeping my patio off in and around my table and the cans so Its not user error. (And I always keep them \"locked\"... which just just. Very loose slide of the plastic lid handle).These are really only good for single use trash collection like at parties and raking the bag out the same day.Doesnt cut it for me and I am super disappointed because they LOOK nice and they arent the cheapest things in the world.",

There are three ways of doing this:  1) To open the entire top (to load or unload a trash bag), hold on to the can's body while pulling up on the very edge of the lip of the lid.  The whole top will swing up.  2) To open the top's hatch (normal use/disposing of trash), find the tab on the hatch lid (about an inch behind the lip).  Pull the tab towards yourself to unlock the hatch; you can then open the hatch.  I recommend locking the hatch after closing it to prevent odor issues.  3) If none of the above work, use a crowbar.

Both have been subjected to the Arizona sun, rain, haboobs and every other weather condition with the exception of snow (although they sit on a patio in freezing temperatures).  It probably would not hold a large amount of water because it is not a solid piece of resin, and fits together like a puzzle that you have to (easily) assemble.    Please see my photo of the product, along with a review, under the name of \"Jen\".  The 1st trash bin purchased, dark brown in color, now sits in a garage corner and is used to store small garden tools.  When hosed off both of these bins look like new.
